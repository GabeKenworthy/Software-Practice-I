My initial thoughts are just to go through the abstract methods and implement them. 
If I run into something I don't undertand, research it until I do.
I'm a little confused. I assume I will be building upon the most recent versions of my ps2/ps3 libraries.

I'm unsure how my project will run. I never got proper feedback on my ps3 nor a grade.
I don't even know If I wrote the right test cases for my ps3.
